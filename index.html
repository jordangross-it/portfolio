                This project was created as a way to develop and refine my HTML and CSS skills through hands-on
                practice. The goal is to achieve a sleek, modern design with a dark theme. While the site is still a
                work in progress, it reflects my commitment to continuous learning and growth in web development.

                I'm currently taking a web development class, and this project is part of my journey to strengthen my
                skills.
                Learning how to build and style websites is important to me because I want to pursue a career in tech,
                and having a solid foundation in HTML and CSS is a great place to start.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                I'm currently a senior majoring in Information Technology at the University of Central Florida.
                Throughout my college experience, I've developed a strong passion for new and emerging technologies. My
                coursework has given me a solid foundation in a variety of areas, including (but not limited to) web
                development, databases,
                operating systems, and programming. These classes have not only strengthened my technical skills but
                also deepened my interest in how technology can be used to solve real-world problems.

                            <em>The Sims</em> and <em>Cities: Skylines</em>. I also appreciate the fast-paced, strategic
                            aspects of competitive games like <em>Fortnite</em>.
