                This page is a fun project I created to practice and experiment with my HTML and CSS skills.
                I'm aiming for a sleek, modern look with a dark theme. It's a work in progress, but I'm excited to keep
                learning and improving as I go!
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I'm currently taking a web development class, and this project is part of my journey to strengthen my
                skills.
                Learning how to build and style websites is important to me because I want to pursue a career in tech,
                and having a solid foundation in HTML and CSS is a great place to start.
            </p>
            <p><br>
                I'm currently a senior majoring in Information Technology at the University of Central Florida.
                Throughout my college experience, I've developed a strong passion for new and emerging technologies. My
                coursework has given me a solid foundation in a variety of areas, including (but not limited to) web development, databases,
                operating systems, and programming. These classes have not only strengthened my technical skills but
                also deepened my interest in how technology can be used to solve real-world problems.

                        <li>I love creative pursuits like interior design, web design, and music. Whether it's arranging
                            a
                            space,
                            building a personal webpage, or experimenting with melodies, I enjoy projects that let me
                            express
                            myself.

                        <li>
                            I'm a big fan of video games, especially life simulation and building games. Titles like
                            <em>The
                                Sims</em> or
                            <em>Cities Skylines</em> let me unwind and be creative. I also enjoy the competitive fun of
                            games
                            like
                            <em>Fortnite</em>.

                            When it comes to movies, I’m drawn to stories with sci-fi and fantasy elements. Whether it’s
                            futuristic tech, magical worlds, or epic adventures, I love getting lost in imaginative
                            universes.
